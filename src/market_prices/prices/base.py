    """Abstract Base Class for serving price data obtained from a source.

    Subclasses should implement the following abstractions:

        - Abstract Class Attributes -

        BaseInterval : Type[intervals._BaseInterval]
            Enumeration with members as TDInterval that represent an
            interval for which subclass requests price data from the
            provider (see 'Serving Price Data' section for notes on which
            intervals should be assigned as base intervals).

            The value of enum members should be defined as a tuple of
            values that would be passed to `timedelta` as positional
            arguments to define the corresponding interval. For
            convenience, common tuples are defined at
            `intervals.TIMEDELTA_ARGS`.

            Example BaseInterval definition:
                BaseInterval = intervals._BaseInterval(
                    "BaseInterval",
                    dict(
                        T1=intervals.TIMEDELTA_ARGS["T1"],  # 1 minute interval
                        T2=intervals.TIMEDELTA_ARGS["T2"],  # 2 minute interval
                        T5=intervals.TIMEDELTA_ARGS["T5"],  # 5 minute interval
                        H1=intervals.TIMEDELTA_ARGS["H1"],  # 1 hour interval
                        D1=intervals.TIMEDELTA_ARGS["D1"],  # 1 day interval
                    ),
                )

            Note: On base class BaseInterval is implemented as a type only.
            This type is not enforced at runtime.

        BASE_LIMITS :
        dict[BI, pd.Timestamp | pd.Timedelta | None]
            key: BaseInterval
                Every base interval should be represented.

            value : pd.Timedelta | pd.Timestamp, optional
                Limit of availability of historal data for the base
                interval, as either timedelta to now or absolute timestamp
                (utc). If interval is daily or higher then timedelta /
                timestamp should be day accurate (no time component) or
                None if limit is unknown. Note: A limit must be defined for
                all intraday base intervals.

            Example, if only 60 days of data are available for data at the
                5 minute base interval, although there is no limit on daily
                data:
                    {BaseInterval.T5: pd.Timedelta(days=60),
                     BaseInterval.D1: None}

            Note: Instance specific base limits are exposed via the
            `base_limits`. By default `base_limits` returns a copy of
            BASE_LIMITS. Subclass instances can use `_update_base_limits`
            to define instance-specific limits, for example if for a
            particular interval data availability differs for specific
            symbols. `_update_base_limits` should be called from the
            extended constructor before executing the constructor as
            defined on the base class.

            Return should include all indices between start and end for

        prices_for_symbols(self, symbols: str): Type[PricesBase]
            Instance of subclass itself for one or more symbols.

    Subclasses can optionally override the following class attributes:

        PM_SUBSESSION_ORIGIN : Literal["open", "break_end"]: default "open"
            Where sessions have a break, declares whether the source
            indexes prices for the pm session based on the morning open
            or the post break pm open, i.e. does the source provide indices
            through the break, as if trading were continuous, or does it
            treat the am and pm sessions distinctly, such that prices for
            the pm subsession commence from the break end.

    Subclasses can optionally extend the following methods:

        __init__():
            All attributes and properties created by the base constructor
            should be preserved.

    All private methods (prefixed with single underscore) are internal to
    the base class. It is not intended that private methods are overriden
    or extended by subclasses.

    The base class also defines a host of public properties and methods.

    Notes
    -----
                        --- Serving Price Data ---

    This section offers notes on the internals of how price data is
    served.

    All calls are served from data of a base interval (of `BaseInterval`).
    Data is served at either a base interval or a higher interval to which
    the base interval data is resampled. The base intervals represent the
    fewest intervals that collectively provide for all data available from
    the source to be evaluated. For example, if the source limits
    availability of both 5 mintute and 15 minute data to the last three
    months then only the 5 minute interval will be included to base
    intervals, with requests for prices at 15 minute intervals served from
    resampled 5 minute data.

    Base intervals can represent an intraday frequencies, for example
    1 minute, 5 minutes etc, or a 'day' in which case the interval
    represents a full trading day. `market_prices` does not support base
    intervals higher than one day.

    All data requested from source is stored locally. Client calls will be
    served from stored data whenever the call can be fully met from stored
    data at a SINGLE base interval, be that by serving the data 'as is' or
    resampling it to a higher interval. Where stored data at a single base
    interval can only partially meet a call, a further request from source
    at that base interval will only be made for the difference between
    stored and required data.

        NB user requests that return price data at a specific interval will
        only be served from price data at a SINGLE base interval, i.e. such
        requests will NOT be met by way of consolidating data from two or
        more base intervals. For example, say base intervals include 1
        minute and 5 minutes and a continuous 10 trading sessions of data
        is stored at the 1 minute interval. If the client requests 12
        trading days at a 5 minute interval and those 12 days include the
        10 days stored at 1 minute then data may (see next paragraphs) be
        requested from source for the full 12 days at the 5 minute
        interval, i.e. notwithstanding that the request could have been met
        by resampling the 10 days stored at 1 minute, requesting only the
        2 days difference at 5 minutes.

    Which base interval is used to evalute prices at a non base interval?

        In the first instance a call will be served from a base interval
        for which data is available over the full required period and which
        can represent the period end as accurately as possible. If there is
        more than one such base interval then will use the highest of these
        for which stored data covers the required period or, if there is no
        such stored data, the highest. NB In certain circumstances where
        consistency of return would be otherwise affected (e.g. where a
        request does not define the required interval) the stored data is
        ignored and the highest of the 'most accurate' base intervals is
        used regardless.

        If there is no base interval for which data is available over the
        full required period and which can represent the period end as
        accurately as possible then a base interval will be used that
        prioritises either the period length or the accuracy of the period
        end. The client can determine this priority with the get() method's
        'priority' parameter, which can take "period" or "end".
            If priority is "period" then of all base intervals that can
            fulfill the period, will use the one which provides for the
            greatest period end accuracy.

            If priority is "end" then of all base intervals that can
            represent the end with greatest accuracy, will use the one that
            provides for the greatest length of period to be fulfilled.

            In either case, if more than one base interval is equally able
            then, as in the first instance, will use the highest of these
            for which stored data is available or, if there is no such
            stored data or consistency of return a consideration, the
            highest.

    Any indice is usually only ever requested once from the source.
    Exceptions:

        If a request includes the current indice of an open exchange
        then further requests will re-request this live indice, so
        as to return the most up-to-date price, until the first
        occasion the indice becomes historic (as opposed to live).

        If all symbols do not share the same delay then any period
        over which price data is not available for all symbols
        (due to the delay) will be re-requested until the first
        request when price data is available for all symbols.

    - Always unavailable base intervals -

    Where prices are obtained for symbols trading on different exchanges,
    base intervals will only be available if indices are aligned. For
    example, if one exchange opens on the hour, say 08.00, and another
    opens at an offset from the hour, say 09.30, then data with a 1 hour
    interval will not align (in this case the first exchange will have
    an indice from 09.00 - 10.00 and the second from 09.30 - 10.30).

    Indices will always be considered to align when they do not conflict.
    For example, indices evaluated from a calendar representing the Hong
    Kong Stock Exchange and indices evaluated from a calendar representing
    the New York Stock Exchange will not be considered unaligned simply
    because these exchanges opening hours do not overlap.

    Non-aligned indices are more common for higher base intervals which
    in turn are those that offer longer periods of price data. Accordingly,
    a longer period of intraday data may be available to a symbol or
    symbols that share the same calendar than if mixed with symbols that
    trade on other calendars which overlap with the symbol's opening hours.

        Related methods:
            .has_single_calendar -> bool
                Query if all symbols share the same calendar.

            ._indices_aligned -> Dict[BaseInterval, pd.Series]:
                Query if indices are aligned. Return by base interval
                and session.

            ._indices_aligned_for_drg -> bool
                Query if all indices are aligned over the daterange
                evalauted by a given 'Getter' instance.

    When data is anchored 'workback' a base interval will be
    unavailable for any period that includes an indice that partially
    covers a period during which no symbol traded (i.e. during the last
    indice of a calendar's session which is unaligned with that session's
    close). This avoids introducing non-trading periods into the indices.

        It is more likely for higher base intervals to be unavailable due
        to the greater likelyhood that indices will be unaligned with the
        session close. In turn, higher base intervals are more likely to
        have longer periods of data available to them. Consequently
        anchoring 'workback' can return price data for a significantly
        lesser period than anchoring 'open' (when strict=False). See the
        `data_availability.ipynb` tutorial for an example

    - All or nothing -

    Data requests are not administered 'by-symbol' but rather on a
    collective basis. Accordingly all requests to source for prices
    will request prices for all symbols (notwithstanding 'include'
    or 'exclude' being passed to `get`).

    For each base interval a DataFrame is used to store requested data.
    Each of these include all symbols.

                hourly intervals to defined datetime (timezone of 'end'
                assumed as most common timezone of all symbols).

        The period over which to get prices can be defined as:

            Either the period between `start` and `end` (end defaults to
            'now' if only `start` is passed).

            Or a duration bound by either `start` or `end`. The duration
            can be defined in terms of any of:
                trading time: pass any combination of `minutes` and
                    `hours`. For a symbol that trades 8 hours a day,
                    hours=24 will return 4 days of data, not 1 day.

                trading sessions: pass `days` (a session is the trading
                    period associated with a specific date).

                calendar time: pass any combination of `weeks`, `months`
                    and `years`.

            It is not possible to combine duration parameters that define
            duration in different terms. For example, the following are
            invalid combinations of period parameters:
                `minutes` and `days`
                `hours` and `days`
                `days` and `months`

        Examples of periods defined by valid combinations of parameters:
            (start='2021-04-15 12:30', end='2021-11-17 16:30') from `start`
                through `end`.
            (start='2021-04-15 12:30') from `start` through to most recent
                available datetime.
            (end='2021-11-17 16:30') from earliest available datetime
                through `end`.
            (hours=2, minutes=30, end='2021-11-17 16:30') the two and a
                half trading hours to 16.30 on 17th November 2021.
            (hours=2, minutes=30, start='2021-04-14 12:30') the two and a
                half trading hours from 12.30 on 14th April 2021.
            (hours=12) the 12 trading hours to the most recent available
                datetime. For many instruments this data will cross more
                than one session.
            (days=20) the 20 consecutive trading days immediately
                preceeding the most recent available datetime.
            (months=3, weeks=2) the 3 months and 2 weeks preceeding most
                recent available datetime.
            () from earliest available datetime through most recent
                available datetime, i.e. all available data.

        Data will NEVER be returned for any date or datetime that falls
        outside of the requested or evaluated `start` / `end` bounds. If
        available data does not align with the bounds then the returned
        data will start and/or end within the bounds, never outside of
        them.
            If `start` or `end` is unaligned and combined with duration
            parameters then the other endpoint is evaluated from the
            algined start / end, not from `start`/`end` as passed.

        Parameters
        ----------
        - Period Parameters -
        These parameters define the period over which to get prices.

        start : Union[pd.Timestamp, str, datetime.datetime, int, float],
        default: earliest available datetime (only if `start` required)
            The first date or minute of the period for which to get
            prices.

            Defining `start` as a date:
                - `start` should be passed as a date, with no time
                    component (or have time component defined as 00:00).
                - If passing as a pd.Timestamp, it should be tz-naive.
                - if `start` does not represent an actual session the
                    period will start at the start of the closest session
                    that follows `start`.

            Defining `start` as a minute:
                - `start` should be defined with a time component.
                - to defne as midnight, pass a tz-aware pd.Timestamp.
                - the timezone of the minute will be assumed as the
                    timestamp's timezone, if passed as a tz-aware
                    pd.Timestamp, or otherwise as `tzin`.

        end : Union[pd.Timestamp, str, datetime.datetime, int, float],
        default: most recent available datetime (only if `end` required)
            The last date or minute of the period for which to get
            prices.

            Defining `end` as a date:
                - `end` should be passed as a date, with no time
                    component (or have time component defined as 00:00).
                - If passing as a pd.Timestamp, it should be tz-naive.
                - if `end` does not represent an actual session the period
                    will end at the end of the closest session that
                    preceeds `end`.

            Defining `end` as a minute:
                - `end` should be defined with a time component.
                - to defne as midnight, pass a tz-aware pd.Timestamp.
                - the timezone of the minute will be assumed as the
                    timestamp's timezone, if passed as a tz-aware
                    pd.Timestamp, or otherwise as `tzin`.

            Note: If `end` parses to a datetime later than 'now' then
            period end will be assumed as 'now'.

        minutes : int, default: 0
            Period duration in minutes. Can be combined with `hours`.

        hours : int, default: 0
            Period duration in hours. Can be combined with `minutes`.

        days : int, default: 0
            Period duration in trading days. Can not be combined with any
            other duration parameter.

        weeks : int, default: 0
            Period duration in calendar weeks. Can be combined with
            `months` and `years`.

        weeks : int, default: 0
            Period duration in calendar months. Can be combined with
            `weeks` and `years`.

        years : int, default: 0
            Period duration in calendar years. Can be combined with
            `weeks` and `months`.

        tzin : Optional[Union[str, BaseTzinfo],
        default: timezone of any `lead_symbol`, otherwise `self.default_tz`
            Timezone of any input to `start` and `end` that represents a
            minte (as opposed to a session).

            Can be passed as a timezone defined as a `str` that's valid
            input to `pytz.timezone`, for example 'utc' or 'US/Eastern`,
            or as an instance of `pytz.timezone`.

            Can alternatively be passed as any symbol of `self.symbols`
            to define as timezone associated with that symbol, for example
            "GOOG".

        add_a_row : bool, default: False
            True:
                Include indice immediately prior to evaluated start.

            This option is useful if evaluating a change over the period.
            For example, if evaluating change over 1 day then will require
            2 days of data (if basing change on difference between close
            prices).

        See period.ipynb tutorial for further explanation and examples of
        period parameters.

        - Parameters related to index -

        interval : str | timedelta | pd.Timedelta, default: inferred
            Time interval to be represented by each price row.

            Pass as either:
                pd.Timedelta: components as either:
                    - minutes and/or hours
                    - days

                timedelta: defined from kwargs passed as either:
                    - minutes and/or hours
                    - days
                    (or equivalent of, i.e seconds=120 is valid although
                    seconds=121 is not.)

                str: comprising:
                    value:
                        one or more digits.
                    unit:
                        "min", "t", "MIN" or "T" for minutes
                        "h" or "H" for hours
                        "d" or "D' for days
                        'm' or "M" for months

            Examples:
                thirty minutes:
                    "30min", "30T"
                    pd.Timedelta(30, "T"), pd.Timedelta(minutes=30)
                    timedelta(minutes=30)

                three hours:
                    "3h", "3H"
                    pd.Timedelta(3, "H"), pd.Timedelta(hours=3)
                    timedelta(hours=3)

                one day:
                    "1d", "1D"
                    pd.Timedelta(1, "D"), pd.Timedelta(days=1)
                    timedelta(days=1), timedelta(1)

                two months:
                    "2m", "2M"

                others:
                    "90min", "90MIN" - ninety minutes
                    "5D", "5d" - five days
                    "40D", "40d" - forty days
                    "1M", "1m" - one month
                    pd.Timedelta(hours=3, minutes=30) - three and a half
                        hours
                    pd.timedelta(hours=1, minutes=20) - one hour and twenty
                        minutes

            Intervals representing months must be defined as a string.

            Value for any unit must not be higher than the following:
            limits:
                minutes: 1320
                hours: 22
                days: 250
                months: 36

            If `interval` is not passed then a suitable interval will be
            inferred from period parameters and available data.

            See intervals.ipynb tutorial for further explanation and
            examples.

        lead_symbol : Optional[str],
        default: symbol associated with most common calendar
            A symbol associated with the calendar that should be used to
            evaluate the period over which prices are returned.

            See periods.ipynb tutorial for further explanation and
            examples of passing lead_symbol.

        anchor : Literal["open", "workback"], default: "open"
            Ignored if interval is (or inferred as) daily or higher.

            Determines the origin (i.e. anchor) against which indices
            should be evaluated.

            "open":
                Group indices by session and anchor the left side of an
                indice on each session open (where session open evaluted as
                for the `lead_symbol`).

                Intervals will all have length `interval`. Only
                circumstance to the contrary is if this would result in the
                last indice of a (sub)session overlapping with the first
                indice of the next (sub)session. In this case a Warning is
                raised to advise that some indices have been curtailed to
                avoid overlapping.

                If `end` infers 'now' and any calendar is open then 'now'
                will fall within the last indice. This last indice will be
                'live' and will update on any further request.

                (Sub)sessions' closes will only be represented by the right
                side of an indice if the interval is a factor of the
                (sub)session duration. Otherwise, the last indice that
                covers part of the (sub)session will have a right side that
                falls after the (sub)session close. Hence, only part of the
                interval covered by this last (sub)session indice will
                represent a trading period (at least as evaluated against
                the `lead_symbol` calendar). NB The `force` option provides
                for curtailing such indices to (sub)session closes.

                If symbols are assoicated with more than one calendar then
                indices may continue after a (sub)session close and/or
                before a (sub)session open (where session evaluated against
                the lead-).

                See 'See Also' section for methods to interrogate nature of
                indices.

            "workback":
                Anchors right side of final interval on the evaluted period
                end and works backwards. Indices evaluated such that each
                has the same interval in terms of trading minutes (where
                trading minutes comprise the union of all trading minutes
                of all calendars).

                Note: If `strict` is False then "workback" can result
                in price data being returned over a significantly
                lesser period than if anchor were "open" (albeit with a
                potentially more accurate last indice). This
                possibility is most notable at higher intervals. See the
                data_availability.ipynb tutorial for examples.

            See anchor.ipynb tutorial for further explanation and examples.

        openend : Literal["maintain", "shorten"], default: "maintain"
            Only relevant if anchor is 'open', otherwise ignored.

            Determines how the final indice should be defined if `end`
            evaluates to a session close (as evaluated against
            `lead_symbol` calendar) which does not align with the indices:

                "maintain" (default) (maintain the interval):
                    The final indice will have length `interval`.

                    Considering the period between the session close and
                    the right of the indice that contains the session
                    close:
                        If no symbol trades during this period then the
                        final indice will be the indice that contains the
                        session close, such that the right side of the
                        final indice will be defined to the right of the
                        session close.

                        If any symbol trades during this period then the
                        final indice will be the latest indice with a
                        right side that preceeds the session close.
                        Consequently the right of the final indice will be
                        to the left of the session close and prices at the
                        session close will not be included.

                    Note: The final indice may still be shortened if
                    `force` is True.

                "shorten":
                    Define final indice shorter than `interval` in order
                    that right side of final indice aligns with session
                    close.

                    The final interval will only be defined in this way
                    if either:
                        No symbol trades during the part of the final
                        indice that falls after the session close.

                        Data is available to create the table by
                        downsampling data of a base interval that aligns
                        with the session close.

                    If it is not possible to define a shorter indice then
                    the final indice will be defined as for "maintain".

            NOTE: In no event will the final indice include prices
            registered after the evaluated period end.

            See anchor.ipynb tutorial for further explanation and examples.

        priority : Literal["period", "end"], default: "end"
            Only relevant if `anchor` is "workback" or `interval` is None.
            Ignored if `composite` is True.

            What should be prioritised when it is possible to only return
            prices EITHER for the full requested period OR with a final
            indice that aligns exactly with the period end.

                "period":
                    Prioritise period length at the expense of the final
                    indice expressing the period end with lesser accuracy
                    than would be possible with a smaller interval.

                "end" (default):
                    Prioritise the accuracy with which the final indice can
                    express the period end at the expense of returning
                    prices for only the later part of the requested period.

                    NB In this case prices will only be returned if`strict`
                    is False. If `strict` is True then a
                    `errors.LastIndiceInaccurateError` will be raised.

            See data_availability.ipynb tutorial for further explanation
            and example usage.

        strict : bool, default: True
            (forced to True if `composite` True)

            What to do if data is only available over part of the
            requested period.
                True (default): raise an error (subclass of
                errors.PricesUnavailableError).

                False: return prices for the later part of the period for
                which data is available.

            See data_availability.ipynb tutorial for example usage.

        composite : bool, default: False
            Only available if `anchor` is 'open' and `interval` is None.

            Should a composite table be returned if this would represent
            the period end with greater accuracy.

                True:
                    Return a composite price table if this allows for the
                    period end to be represented with a greater accuracy
                    than a table with a regular interval.

                    Composite table will comprise two intervals, a higher
                    interval for which price data is available over the
                    full requested period and a lower interval that can
                    express the period end with the greatest possible
                    accuracy.

                    ValueError will be raised if `interval` is not None
                    or `anchor` is not "open".

                False (default):
                    Do not return a composite table.

            See data_availability.ipynb tutorial for example usage.

        force : bool, default: False
            Only available if anchor is 'open'.
            Not relevant if interval is daily or higher.

            True:
                Force indices to only cover periods during which at least
                one symbol trades.

                If the left side of the first indice of a session is
                earlier that the earliest session open of any calendar
                then the indice will be curtailed with the left side being
                forced forward to the earliest session open.

                If the right side of the last indice of a session is
                later that the latest session close of any calendar then
                the indice will be curtailed with the right side being
                forced back to the latest session close.

                Any indice that partially covers a session break will
                similarly by curtailed if no other symbol trades during the
                period that conincides with the break. Indices that include
                the morning subsession close will have their right side
                forced back to that close whilst indices that include the
                afternoon subsession open will have their left side forced
                forward to that open.

            Notes:

                Any indice that is forced will be shorter than `interval`
                and the table interval will become irregular.

                ValueError will be raised if `force` True and `anchor` is
                passed as "workback".

                See 'See Also' section for methods to interrogate trading
                status of indices.

            See anchor.ipynb tutorial for further explanation and examples
            of using the `force` option.

         - Post-processing options (formatting and tidying) -

        tzout : Optional[Union[str, BaseTzinfo],
        default: as `tzin` if `interval` intraday, otherwise None
            Timezone to set index to.

            If interval daily or higher:

                Can only accept "utc", pytz.UTC or (for tz-naive dates)
                None.

            If interval intraday:

                Can be passed as a timezone defined as a `str` that's valid
                input to `pytz.timezone`, for example 'utc' or
                'US/Eastern`, or as an instance returned from
                `pytz.timezone`.

                Can alternatively be passed as any symbol of `self.symbols`
                to define as timezone associated with that symbol, for
                example "GOOG".

            Note: If table is returned as a composite comprising both daily
            and intraday data then `tzout` will be forced to "UTC". In this
            case it should be noted that prices over the daily part of the
            table reflect session prices, not prices between successive
            midnight UTC.

        fill : Optional[Literal["ffill", "bfill", "both"]], default: None
            Fill missing values where a symbol's calendar is not open
            during the interval covered by an indice.

                "ffill": fill 'open', 'high', 'low' and 'open' values with
                closest prior close value.

                "bfill": fill 'open', 'high', 'low' and 'open' values with
                closest subsequent open value.

                "both": first fill as "ffill" and then fill any missing
                values at the start of the table with "bfill".

                None: (default) do not fill.

        include : Union[List[str], str], optional
            Symbol or symbols to include. All other symbols will be
            excluded. If passed, do not pass `exclude`.

        exclude : Union[List[str], str], optional
            Symbol or symbols to include. All other symbols will be
            included. If passed, do not pass `include`.

        side : Optional[Literal['left', 'right']], default: None
            Ignored if interval is (or inferred as) daily.

            Determines index:

                None (default):
                    Index with IntervalIndex.

                "left":

                    each interval.

                "right":
                    Index with DatetimeIndex representing the right side of
                    each interval.

            Note: If passed as "left" or "right" then returned DataFrame

                Returned DataFrame will not have access to the .pt
                accessor.

            False (default):
                Return 'open', 'high', 'low', 'close' and 'volume' columns.

        lose_single_symbol : bool, default: False
            Ignored if `close_only` is True.

            True:
                If prices are for a single symbol then will lose symbol
                level from columns MultiIndex. Columns will be labelled
                instead with simple pd.Index.

        Raises
        ------
        `ValueError`
            If an invalid combination of parameters are passed.

            This includes any of the following invalid combinations of
            period parameters:
                `end` and `start` and a duration parameter.
                `minutes` and/or `hours` and any other duration parameter.
                `days` and any other duration parameter.

        `errors.PricesUnavailableError`
            If price data is not available for the passed parameters then a
            subclass of `errors.PricesUnavailableError` will be raised
            which describes the specific cause.

                errors.PricesDateRangeEmpty:
                        Requested period contains no trading session/minutes.

                errors.PricesIntradayUnavailableError:
                    Intraday price data is not available over the full
                    requested period for the passed (or inferred) interval.

                errors.LastIndiceInaccurateError:
                    Intraday price data is not available over the full
                    requested period at a sufficiently low interval to
                    represent the period end with the greatest possible
                    accuracy.

                    Can only be raised if `strict` is True and `priority`
                    is "end".

                errors.PricesUnavailableFromSourceError:
                    Price data not returned from source over a period for
                    which prices would be expected to be available.

                errors.PricesUnavailableIntervalDurationError:
                    `interval` is greater than a period duration defined in
                    terms of 'minutes' and/or 'hours'.

                errors.PricesUnavailableIntervalPeriodError:
                    An intraday or daily `interval` is longer than the
                    evaluated period.

                    Note: This error can be raised if `anchor` is "open"
                    and `start` and `end` are values that cover a period
                    greater than the interval although the indice bounds
                    they evaluate to do not. For example, if a session
                    opens at 09.00, `start` is 09.01 and `end` is 09.09
                    then a call for data at a "5T" `interval` will evalute
                    the period bounds as from 09.05 through 09.05.

                errors.PricesUnavailableDOIntervalPeriodError:
                    Monthly `interval` is longer than the evaluated period.

                errors.PricesUnvailableInferredIntervalError
                    `interval` is None and inferred as intraday although
                    the request can only be met with daily data.

                errors.PricesUnvailableDurationConflict:
                    Interval is daily although duration specified in hours
                    and/or minutes.

                errors.StartNotEarlierThanEnd:
                    `start` passed as a date or minute that is later than
                    the passed `end`.

                errors.EndTooEarlyError:
                    `end` is or resolves to a session/minute before the
                    first session/minute for which prices are available
                    at any interval.

                    Note: Call `limits` for limits by base interval.

                    Note: errors.EndOutOfBoundsError will be raised if
                    session/minute is earlier than the first session/minute
                    of the associated calendar.

                errors.StartTooEarlyError:
                    `start` is or resolves to a session/minute before the
                    first session/minute for which prices are available at
                    any interval.

                    Note: Call `limits` for limits by base interval.

                    Note: errors.StartOutOfBoundsError will be raised if
                    session/minute is earlier than the first session/minute
                    of the associated calendar.

                errors.EndOutOfBoundsError:
                    `end` is or resolves to a session/minute earlier than
                    the associated calendar's first session/minute.

                errors.StartOutOfBoundsError:
                    `start` is or resolves to a session/minute earlier than
                    the associated calendar's first session/minute.

                errors.StartTooLateError:
                    `start` is or resolves to a session/minute later than
                    the most recent session/minute for which prices are
                    available.

        Warnings
        --------
        A subclass of `errors.PricesWarning` will be raised to offer
        advices in the event an operation has been undertaken that could
        result in prices differenting from what user may have reasonably
        assumed:

            errors.PricesMissingWarning:
                Prices not returned from source for at least one session
                for which prices were expected to be available at a
                specific base interval. Warning message advises of those
                sessions for which data is missing.

            errors.IntervalIrregularWarning:
                Interval irregular as a result of the last indice of one or
                more sessions being curtailed so as not to overlap with the
                first indice of the following session.

                This warning can not be raised when all symbols are
                associated with the same calendar.

            errors.DuplicateIndexWarning:
                Indices were removed from data received from source as a
                result of duplications. Warning message includes advices of
                removed indices.

        Returns
        -------
        pd.DataFrame

            Return prices as a pd.DataFrame with a .pt accessor:

                index : Union[pd.IntervalIndex, pd.DatetimeIndex]

                    If `interval` passed or infered as intraday:
                        pd.IntervalIndex with each row covering prices for
                        time interval defined by the indice (closed left).

                    if `interval` passed or infered as daily:
                        pd.DatetimeIndex with each row covering prices for
                        session indicated by indice.

                    if `interval` greater than one day:
                        pd.IntervalIndex with each row covering prices over
                        sessions defined by indice (closed left such that
                        prices exclusive of session defined as indices'
                        right side).

                columns : pd.MultiIndex
                    level 0: symbol
                    level 1: ['open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume']

            - pd.DataFrame.pt PricesTable accessor -
            The .pt accessor offers price-related functionality via access
            to the methods of one of the following classes:
                `pt.PTDaily`: if price data is daily (i.e. by session).

                `pt.PTIntraday`: if price data is intraday.

                `pt.PTMultipleSessions`: if price data has an interval
                higher than one day.

                `pt.PTDailyIntradayComposite`: if price table is a
                composite where first part of table has a one day interval
                and final part has an intraday interval.

            Note: .pt accessor will not be available if:
                `side` not None and `interval` not daily (or inferred as
                daily).
                `close_only` passed as True.

            See following 'See Also' section for example usage.
            See pt_accessor.ipynb tutorial for examples of all .pt methods.

        See Also
        --------
        Tutorials are vailable that offer comprehensive explanation and
        example usage of the `get` method. See the project home page.

        The following .pt methods can be used to interrogate whether indices
        cover trading periods, non-trading periods or partial trading
        periods (where an exchange traded during only part of the period
        covered by the indice):
            .indices_trading_status()
            .indices_all_trading()
            .indices_trading()
            .indices_non_trading()
            .indices_partial_trading()
            .indices_partial_trading_info()

        The following .pt methods can be used to interrogate the number of
        trading minutes associated with indices (`pt.PTIntraday` only):
            indices_trading_minutes()
            indices_trading_minutes_values()
            trading_minutes_interval()
            indices_have_regular_trading_minutes()

        The following .pt properties can be used to interrogate the length
        of indice intervals (`pt.PTIntraday` only):
            indices_length
            by_indice_length

        Example usage:
            prices = PricesYahoo('GOOG AZN.L', lead_calendar='GOOG')
            table = prices.get(days=5)
            table.pt.indices_non_trading(calendar=prices.calendars['GOOG'])
            table.pt.indices_partial_trading(
                calendar=prices.calendars['AZN.L']
            )

        See 'Notes' section of PricesBase.__doc__ for under-the-bonnet
        notes explaining how price data is served.

        EITHER at which price data is available for any symbol and at least

        NOTE: For any symbol subject to a real-time price delay, if
        `minute` is None (default), or a minute within the period for which
        prices are currently delayed, then the price will not be the actual

            Minute at which require price data.

            By default (None) will return the most recent available prices.

            Will raise ValueError if `minute` passed as a date. To
            request prices at a minute representing midnight pass as a
            timezone aware pd.Timestamp.

        tz : Optional[Union[str, pytz.BaseTzInfo]], default: `default_tz`
            Timezone of `minute` (if `minute` otherwise timezone naive) and
            for returned index. Can be passed as:

                pytz.BaseTzInfo:

                str:
                    - valid input to `pytz.timezone`, for example "utc" or
                    "US/Eastern".
                    - any symbol of `symbols`. For example, pass "GOOG" to
                    define timezone as timezone associated with that
                    symbol.

            If `minute` is tz-aware then `tz` will NOT override the
            timezone of `the `minute` although `tz` will be used as the
            output timezone.

        """Return OHLCV data for a period.

        Returns the following for each symbol:
            'open' - price at start of the period.
            'high' - highest price registered during the period.
            'low' - lowest price registered during the period.
            'close' - price at end of the period.
            'volume' - total volume registered over the period.

        Period defined from parameters in the same was as for the `get`
        method when `anchor` is open. See `get.__doc__`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        Method parameters as for `get`, except:

        tzout : Optional[Union[str, BaseTzinfo], default: as `tzin`
            Timezone of period as expressed by the index (or level 0 of).

            Defined in same way as `tzout` parameter of `get`.

            Index expressing period will always be tz-aware. If `tzout` is
            not passed then by default period will be expressed with
            timezone as that which `tzin` evalutes to (see `get.__doc__`).

        stack: bool  (default: False)
            False: (default) Return single-row DataFrame with 'open',
            'high', 'low', 'close' and 'volume' columns for every symbol.

            True: Return multi-row DataFrame with each row representing
            one symbol and columns as 'open', 'high', 'low', 'close' and
            'volume'.

        underlying: bool  (default: False)
            Return 2-tuple with second item as underlying Dataframe of
            prices over the period. NB this DataFrame is equivalent to
            calling `get` with the passed parameters, 'anchor' as "open" and
            'composite' as True.

        Returns
        -------
        Union[pd.DataFrame, tuple[pd.DataFrame, pd.DataFrame]]

            If `stack` False and `underlying` False (default): pd.DataFrame
                Single-row pd.DataFrame with 'open', 'high' 'low', 'close'
                and 'volume' columns for each symbol.

                index: pd.IntervalIndex
                    pd.Interval describing period over which price data
                    corresponds. Get timezone of indice by calling
                    `df.pt.tz`.

                columns: pd.MultiIndex.
                    level 0: pd.Index
                        symbols.

                    level 1: pd.Index
                        'open', 'close', 'high' 'low' 'volume'.

            If `stack` is True and underlying False: pd.DataFrame
                Multi-row pd.DataFrame with each row representing a symbol.

                index: pd.MultiIndex
                    level 0: IntervalIndex
                        pd.Interval describing period over which price data
                        corresponds. Get timezone of indice by calling
                        `df.index.levels[0].left.tz`.

                    level 1: pd.Index
                        symbols.

                columns: pd.Index
                    'open', 'close', 'high' 'low' 'volume'.

            If underlying is True: tuple[pd.DataFrame, pd.DataFrame]]
                [0] As above

                [1] Underlying Dataframe from which range data evaluated.
                NB this DataFrame is equivalent to calling `get` with the
                passed parameters, 'anchor' as "open" and 'composite' as
                True.
