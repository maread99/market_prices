# market_prices

[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/market-prices)](https://pypi.org/project/market-prices/) ![Python Support](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/market-prices) [![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)

A python library to create **meaningful** OHLCV datasets for financial instruments.

`market_prices` provides for enhanced querying and post-processing of financial price data.

Works out-the-box with prices from the Yahoo Finance API via [yahooquery][yahooquery] (see [Disclaimers](https://github.com/maread99/market_prices#disclaimers)).

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install market-prices
```

## Quickstart

```python
>>> from market_prices import PricesYahoo
>>> prices = PricesYahoo("MSFT")  # prices for a single instrument, Microsoft
>>> prices.get("5min", minutes=40)  # last 40 minutes of prices at 5 minute intervals
```
```

The above call was made 21 minutes after the NYSE open. Notice that the call returns the last 40 **trading minutes** of data, NOT the arbitrary number of trading minutes that may have fallen within the last 40 minutes according to the clock on the wall.

Any interval can be evaluated (limited only by the availability of underlying data).

Although some indices are longer than three calendar days, they all comprise of three **trading days** (sessions) of data (all indices are closed on the 'right', such that data includes the session that represents the left side of the interval but NOT any session that might be represented by the right side.). Also, the period the dataset covers is 12 sessions, NOT the arbitrary number of sessions that fell within the last 12 days according to the calendar hanging on the wall.

`market_prices` comes into its own with the creation of datasets comprising instruments that trade on different exchanges.
```python
>>> # Get a prices instance for Microsoft in New York, Alibaba in Hong Kong and 24/7 Bitcoin
>>> prices_mult = PricesYahoo("MSFT, 9988.HK, BTC-USD")
>>> # lead_symbol determines the exchange against which the period will be evaluated and
>>> # the default output time zone (which for Bitcoin is UTC).
>>> prices_mult.get("90T", hours=9, lead_symbol="BTC-USD")
```
```

By default prices are shown as missing when the exchange is closed (the time zone of the above output is UTC). Indices that would cover periods during which no symbol trades are excluded. (Scroll right on the output to see all the returned data.)

*Within* any session missing prices between the open and the close are always filled with contiguous data. This happens even for illiquid instruments where the price data alone may give no indication of a session's open or close. (See the [exchange_calendars](#exchange_calendars) section for how `market_prices` 'knows' the trading times of each symbol.)

The `get` method has plenty of options to customize the output, including `fill` to fill in indices when an exchange is closed...
```python
>>> # as before, only now filling in prices when exchanges are closed
>>> prices_mult.get("90T", hours=9, lead_symbol="BTC-USD", fill="both")

The `indices_trading_minutes` method called above is available via the `.pt` accessor. (`market_prices` uses the `.pt` accessor to make available a host of properties and methods to directly interrogate the price data.)

Whereas the above examples used the `get` method to create a dataset, the following methods provide for more specific queries.

`close_at` returns the most recent close price as of a specific date.
```python
>>> prices_mult.close_at("2022-06-27")
```
```
symbol            MSFT     9988.HK       BTC-USD
2022-06-27  264.890015  118.099998  20735.478516
```
`price_at` returns prices as at a specific minute.
```python
>>> prices_mult.price_at("2022-06-27 16:22", tz="MSFT")
```
```
symbol                           MSFT     9988.HK       BTC-USD
2022-06-27 16:22:00-04:00  264.920013  118.099998  20922.904297
```
`price_range` returns OHLCV data over a period defined with the same arguments as `get`.
```python
>>> # ohlcv data for period comprising 3 sessions to a specific time
>>> prices_mult.price_range(end="2022-06-07 15:22", days=3, lead_symbol="MSFT", stack=True)
```
```

The [quickstart.ipynb](https://github.com/maread99/market_prices/blob/master/docs/tutorials/quickstart.ipynb) tutorial offers a fuller introduction. [Here](https://github.com/maread99/market_prices/blob/master/docs/tutorials_docs.md) you'll find links to all the tutorials which collectively cover all that `market_prices` offers.

## Features include:
* Include **securities trading on different exchanges** with differing opening hours across different time zones.
* Request the **period** covered by a dataset in terms of either:
    * trading time (minutes and hours).
    * number of sessions (days).
    * calendar time (weeks, months and years).
* Request data at **ANY interval** (pretty much).
* Use properties and functions of the **`pd.DataFrame.pt` accessor** to interrogate and operate directly on price tables.
* **Anchor** indices either:
    * on each (sub)session open.
    * on the period end and work back (crossing sessions).
* Price tables indexed with a pandas `IntervalIndex` that defines both sides of the time interval covered by each row.
* Respects **breaks** in exchanges that observe separate morning and afternoon subsessions.
* Indices excluded for any periods when no underlying exchange is open.
* Fills **missing prices**, by security, within the bounds of trading hours (zero leakage).
    * Optionally fills missing values outside of trading hours (for multiple securities with different opening hours).
* **Efficient data-usage** (only requests data required and only requests any data point once).
* **Data source flexibility** (use any data source by concreting the ABC).

## Tutorials / Documentation
`market_prices` comes with a host of notebook [tutorials](https://github.com/maread99/market_prices/blob/master/docs/tutorials_docs.md#tutorials) that show example usage and explain every aspect of what's on offer. Check out [quickstart.ipynb](https://github.com/maread99/market_prices/blob/master/docs/tutorials/quickstart.ipynb) for a taster.

All tutorials and other documentation are indexed [here](https://github.com/maread99/market_prices/blob/master/docs/tutorials_docs.md).

Each method's own documentation is also pretty comprehensive.

## market_analy
The [market_analy](https://github.com/maread99/market_analy) library uses prices data from `market_prices` to undertake analyses and create interactive bqplot charts. The [demo video](https://vimeo.com/801302973) covers usage of both libraries.

## exchange_calendars
`market_prices` is nothing without [`exchange_calendars`](https://github.com/gerrymanoim/exchange_calendars).

`exchange_calendars` provides `market_prices`:
* Knowledge of underlying exchanges' opening times.
* A wealth of functionality to interrogate exchanges' sessions and trading minutes.

This knowledge and functionality allows `market_prices` to:
* Index prices according to exchanges' opening hours.
* Evaluate periods defined in terms of trading minutes or sessions.

## Data sources
The functionality offered by `market_prices` is not reliant on any particular data source, but it does need one!

The default prices class, `PricesYahoo`, employs the [yahooquery][yahooquery] library to fetch raw price data. A different data source can be used by simply concreting a subclass of the Abstract Base Class [`PricesBase`](https://github.com/maread99/market_prices/blob/master/src/market_prices/prices/base.py) (see the [developer docs](docs/developers/serving_data.md)).

> :information_source: [yahooquery][yahooquery] offers broad pythonic access to the Yahoo API - check it out if you're after other financial data!

### Calendar maintenance
If you come across missing prices or sessions then the first port of call is to check that the associated calendar is accurate - it may need updating.

* If prices are not included for a session, the calendar may be assuming that day is a holiday.
* If prices are included on a day when the exchange was closed, the calendar is probably assuming that day represents a trading session. In this case prices for the non-trading day will have a constant value and a `errors.PricesMissingWarning` will have been raised when the prices were requested.

All calendars are maintained by user-contributions. If you find one that needs updating, PR the required changes over at `exchange_calendars` and it'll filter into `market_prices` on the next `exchange_calendars` release. Links to the workflow to update calendars can be found [here](https://github.com/gerrymanoim/exchange_calendars#frequently-asked-questions).

The [prices tutorial](https://github.com/maread99/market_prices/blob/master/docs/tutorials/prices.ipynb) covers how `market_prices` associates calendars with symbols.

## Release schedule, bugs, development and feedback

The first beta version of `market_prices` was released May 2022.

Whilst the test suite is pretty comprehensive, there will inevitably be bugs. Please do raise an [issue](https://github.com/maread99/market_prices/issues) with any that you come across. Even better, offer a PR! Contributions welcome.

Please use [discussions](https://github.com/maread99/market_prices/discussions) to make any suggestions and offer general feedback.

## Disclaimers

`market_prices` should not be assumed sufficiently reliable to undertake market analysis intended to inform investment decisions. Users should inspect the source code and the test suite of the library and its dependencies in order to make their own assessment of the packages' suitability for their purposes. **`market_prices` is used entirely at the user's own risk.**

### **Yahoo APIs**

The default `PricesYahoo` class requests data from publically available Yahoo APIs via the [yahooquery][yahooquery] package.

**`market_prices` is NOT in any way affiliated, partnered, sponsored or endorsed by Yahoo. Users of the `PricesYahoo` class should make enquiries to satisfy themselves that they are eligible to receive data from  _Yahoo APIs_ and are in compliance with the license requirements and Terms of Service under which the _Yahoo APIs_ may be accessed, to include restrictions concerning NO COMMERCIAL USE.**

Users may find the following references useful in this respect. (These references should not be considered to definitively cover all terms and conditions related to the use of _Yahoo APIs_.)

* [Yahoo Developer API Terms of Use](https://legal.yahoo.com/us/en/yahoo/terms/product-atos/apiforydn/index.html)
* [Yahoo Terms of Service](https://legal.yahoo.com/us/en/yahoo/terms/otos/index.html)
* [Yahoo Terms index](https://policies.yahoo.com/us/en/yahoo/terms/index.htm)

Further, it should NOT be assumed that price data returned by the `PricesYahoo` class will accurately reflect data as provided by _Yahoo APIs_. In this respect users should make their own inspection of the source code and test suites of `market_prices` and its dependencies.
