requirements_test.txt is in this dedicated directory simply so that
dependabot can be configured to look only at thses dependencies and ignore
the additional requirements in requirements_dev.txt.

Dependabot has to look at requirements_test.txt, as opposed to simply
requirements.txt, in order that the tests triggered by the dependabot PR
run in an environment that has installed the bumped versions of the
dependencies.
